# ce07 TITLE TBD

This class exercise is designed to get you aquainted with TODO.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

* A basic understanding of creating and implementing interfaces in Java.
* https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/interfaces/interfaces.md
* ANYTHING ELSE?

## Questions

In your notes, clearly answer the following questions. These instructions assume that you are 
logged into the Nike server. 

**NOTE:** If a step requires you to enter in a command, please provide in your notes the full 
command that you typed to make the related action happen. If context is necessary (e.g., the 
command depends on your present working directory), then please note that context as well.

### Getting Started

1. Use Git to clone the repository for this exercise onto Nike into a subdirectory called `cs1302-ce07`:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-ce07.git
   ```
1. Change into the `cs1302-ce07` directory that was just created and look around. There should be
   multiple Java files contained within the directory structure. To see a listing of all of the 
   files under the `src` subdirectory, use the `find` command as follows:
   
   ```
   $ find src
   ```
   
   For each Java file in the `cs1302-ce07` subdirectory, fill out a table similar to the following:
   
   | Name of the Java file | Interface or Implementing Class | Fully Qualified Name (FQN) |
   |-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
   |-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
   |-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
   |-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
   
1. List the abstract methods found in the `Driveable` interface.

1. Generate the API documentation website for all of the code in the `cs1302` package. 
   Host the documentation on Nike using `cs1302-ce07-doc` as the name for your symbolic link.
   What is the URL to your hosted website?
   
1. Look at the `speedUp` method in the `Car.java` file. Compare the Javadoc comment for the
   method in that file to the documentation listed for that method in the API documentation
   website. What do you notice? How is this possible?
