# ce07 Evolving an Interface

![Approved for: Spring 2020](https://img.shields.io/badge/Approved%20for-Spring%202020-blue)

This class exercise explores how to evolve an interface in Java without the need to
modify all of implementing classes. It also touches on how to commit and view changes
to a local Git repository.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

* A basic understanding of creating and implementing interfaces in Java.
* CSCI 1302 [Default Methods Tutorial](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/default-methods/default-methods.md)

## Course-Specific Learning Outcomes

* **LO2.e:** (Partial) Utilize existing generic methods, interfaces, and classes in a software solution.
* **LO3.b:** Create class, interface, method, and inline documentation that satisfies a 
set of requirements.
* **LO3.c:** Generate user-facing API documentation for a software solution.
* **L04.b:** Utilize interface-based polymorphism in a software solution.

## Questions

In your notes, clearly answer the following questions. These instructions assume that you are 
logged into the Nike server. 

**NOTE:** If a step requires you to enter in a command, please provide in your notes the full 
command that you typed to make the related action happen. If context is necessary (e.g., the 
command depends on your present working directory), then please note that context as well.

### Getting Started

1. Use Git to clone the repository for this exercise onto Nike into a subdirectory called `cs1302-ce07`:

   ```
   $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-ce07.git
   ```

1. **[ALL GROUP MEMBERS]**
   Setup your Git username and email on Nike by modifiying and executing the commands below. 
   When setting the `user.name` property, please provide your name as it appears on eLC and
   Athena. If you have a preferred name, then you may include it in parentheses. For the
   `user.email` property, please use your `@uga.edu` email address:

   ```
   $ git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa (Liz)"
   $ git config --global user.email "email@uga.edu"
   ```
   
   You can verify that these properties were setup correctly by observing the output of
   the following commands:
   
   ```
   $ git config --global user.name
   $ git config --global user.email
   ```

1. Change into the `cs1302-ce07` directory that was just created and look around. There should be
   multiple Java files contained within the directory structure. To see a listing of all of the 
   files under the `src` subdirectory, use the `find` command as follows:
   
   ```
   $ find src
   ```
   
   For each Java file under the `src` subdirectory, fill out a row in a table similar to the 
   following in your notes:

   **Note:** If a class is not an interface and does not implement an interface, write `NA` in the second
   column. Also, the "Depends On" column should list any Java types in the `cs1302.ce07` package that the file
   is dependent upon. 
   
   | Name of the Java file | Interface or Implementing Class? | Fully Qualified Name (FQN) | Depends On |
   |-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------|
   |-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------|
   |-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------|
   |-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------|

   The "Depends On" column should list any Java types in the `cs1302.ce07` package that the file
   is dependent upon. 
   
1. Make sure you are in the `cs1302-ce07` directory.
   Individually compile each `.java` specifying `bin` as the default package location for compiled code.
   Only specify the class path option when absolutely necessary.
   You may need to create the `bin` directory if it does not already exist.
   Write down the commands that you used in the order that you used them.
   
1. Create and document an additional class within the `cs1302.ce07.impl` package that implements the `Drivable` 
   interface. Feel free to reuse one of the classes you or one of your group members created in a previous
   class exercise. If you do resuse a class that you already wrote, then take special care to update its
   package information, make sure it's documented properly, and ensure that implements the version of the
   interface provided by this exercise. What is the fully qualified name of the class
   that you added?

1. Make sure you are in the `cs1302-ce07` directory.
   Compile the class you added in the previous step. 
   Write down any commands that you used in the order you used them.

1. Generate the API documentation website for all of the code in the `cs1302` package
   into the `doc` directory. You may need to create the `doc` directory if it does not already exist.
   Host the documentation on Nike using `cs1302-ce07-doc` as the name for your symbolic link.
   What is the URL to your hosted website?
   
1. Run the 1302 `checkstyle` program on all `.java` files. If errors are reported, look up each error 
   message in the [Style Guide](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-styleguide), fix the error, and 
   repeat until no style errors remain.
   
1. Make sure you are in the `cs1302-ce07` directory.
   In this step, you will do your first commit to your local git repository (on the Nike server) so 
   that you (and the instructors/TAs) can see what you've done. For now, think of a commit as saving 
   a snapshot of your progress in the exercise. We will use many additional features of git in future
   tutorials and exercises. These features include, but are not limited to, creating multiple development 
   branches, rolling back to a previous snapshot (version of the code), and collaborating with teammates.
   
   Use the following commands to tell Git to add and commit the changes that you made to your
   source code to your local copy of the repository for this exercise. 
   Modify the string associated with the `-m` (message) option to give a brief, one sentence 
   description of the changes you made to the source code.
   
   ```
   $ git add src
   $ git commit -m "added SomeClass that represents SOMETHING and implements Drivable."
   ```

**CHECKPOINT**

1. Add an `enum` called `LicenseClass` to the interface that represents the different
   license classifications for the people who drive the things that are
   `Drivable`. You may find it helpful to review the example from the default methods
   tutorial in 
   [`Styleable.java`](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/default-methods/src/cs1302/interfaces/contract/Styleable.java#L23). Each implementing class can 
   set its license classification accordingly.
   For example, an `Airplane` class would use the `Aircraft` specification since all
   airplane operators need that specific classification on their license.
   Below is a list of license classification descriptions that must
   be supported. Your group should decide on reasonable names for the actual
   enumeration constants:

   * Non-Commercial Roadway
   * Commercial Roadway
   * Watercraft
   * Aircraft
   * Unclassified

   Make sure to provide a Javadoc comment for the `enum` that describes the type
   itself as well as the constants that it enumerates.

1. Modify the `Drivable` interface to include a default method called `getLicenseClass`
   that takes no parameters and returns a `LicenseClass`. Among the enumeration
   constants that your group included in `LicenseClass`, pick one that you would consider
   is a safe choice to use as a default value. Your default method should return that
   constant. Remember, you are providing a default implementation. At this point, you
   don't have a specific object and you don't know the class of the object. You are
   simply providing a default implementation so the other classes that implement `Drivable`
   don't _have_ to change in order to compile.

1. Fully document all aspects of the `getLicenseClass` method using a Javadoc comment.
   Remember, most people will not see the inside of your method--they will only use it.
   Be sure to consider this when writing your Javadoc comment. 

1. Compile your interface and update the documentation website. Look at the `Car` class documentation
   on the website. Compare the `getLicenseClass` method with the `speedUp` method. What do
   you notice? Briefly explain the difference in your notes.
   
1. Update the `cs1302.ce07.Driver` class.

   * Update the `test` method to print the return value of the `Drivable` object's
     `getLicenseClass` method. Be sure to update the corresponding Javadoc
     comment.

   * Update the `main` method to create an object of the class you added for
     the previous checkpoint and test it with the `test` method. Please use `Drivable`
     for the variable type so as to remain consistent with other objects.

   Recompile all code and test it by running `cs1302.ce07.Driver`.
   Write the license class for each `Drivable` object that was output (they should be the same)
   in your notes.

1. Regenerate the API documentation website for all of the code in the `cs1302` package.
   What is the direct URL to the API documentation for the default  method that you wrote
   for this checkpoint?

1. Run the 1302 `checkstyle` program on all `.java` files. If errors are reported, look up each error 
   message in the [Style Guide](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-styleguide), fix the error, and 
   repeat until no style errors remain.
   
1. Use Git to commit your source code changes to your local copy of the exercise repository.
   Since you haven't added any new source code files for this checkpoint, you can skip the
   `git add` step if, and only if, you add an additional `-a` option with `git commit`.
   Modify the string associated with the `-m` (message) option to give a brief, one sentence 
   description of the changes you made to the source code.
   What was the command you used to commit?

**CHECKPOINT**

1. In the new class that you added to the `cs1302.ce07` package, provide an implementation of the
   `getLicenseClass` method. It should return a license classification that differs from
   the one returned by the default method in the interface.

1. Update the `main` method in the `cs1302.ce07.Driver` class:

   * Instead of creating multiple `Drivable` variables in the `main` method, refactor 
     the code to take a single array of `Drivable` objects. Something like the following 
     (may need to be modified):

     ```java
     Drivable[] drivables = new Drivable[] {
         new Car(185.5), // fast car
         new Car(75.0)   // slow car
     };
     ```

   * Loop over the array, and call the `test` method twice on each array element with
     different `speedupAmount` and `slowdownAmount` values.

   Recompile all code and test it by running `cs1302.ce07.Driver`.
   What is the license class in the class you added earlier?

1. Regenerate the API documentation website for all of the code in the `cs1302` package.
   What is the direct URL to the API documentation for the class that you wrote
   for this checkpoint? Look at the `getLicenseClass` method in the documentation for
   the class you added. What do you notice now that you overrode the default method?

1. Run the 1302 `checkstyle` program on all `.java` files. If errors are reported, look up each error 
   message in the [Style Guide](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-styleguide), fix the error, and 
   repeat until no style errors remain.
   
1. Use Git to commit your source code changes to your local copy of the exercise repository.
   Since you haven't added any new source code files for this checkpoint, you can skip the
   `git add` step if, and only if, you add an additional `-a` option with `git commit`.
   Modify the string associated with the `-m` (message) option to give a brief, one sentence 
   description of the changes you made to the source code.
   What was the command you used to commit?

1. Use Git to view your commit log:

   ```
   $ git log
   ```
   
   For more concise output, use the following:
   
   ```
   $ git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
   ```
   
**CHECKPOINT**
    
1. If you want to create beautiful ASCII text, then try the FIGlet tool:

   ```
   $ figlet hello!
   ```
   
1. The FIGlet tool also reads from standard input!

   ```
   $ figlet
   ```
   
   Just as with `cat`, use `C-d` to send the `EOF`.
   
1. Let its standard input come from another program using a pipe:

   ```
   $ find src -name "*.java" | figlet -w 100 -f slant
   ```

1. Read the manual page:

   ```
   $ man figlet
   ```
   
1. You can see the list of available fonts using the following command:

   ```
   $ showfigfonts
   ```
